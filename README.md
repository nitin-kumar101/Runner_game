# Runner Game

This Game is an interactive game where the player controls a character who runs and collects coins to increase their score while avoiding obstacles. The motivation behind this project was to learn and understand the basics of Python programming and its Pygame library. The game utilizes animated movements of the character, background, obstacles, and coins to create an engaging gameplay experience.
